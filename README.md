# MyKivyTutorialLog

A log of my studies on the Kivy tutorial available from HashLDash 's Youtube channel.

My log and code comments are in English where possible. Small adjustments to the code, file names, variable names, etc. may happen for the sake of my objectives, so some minor things may be different from the original code shown in the video tutorial.

His Kivy video tutorial is in Brazilian Portuguese.

This is an important procedure that had to be executed before I started following the tutorial. As not all Python projects are going to use Kivy, it is important to install it under a virtual environment: https://kivy.org/doc/stable/installation/installation-windows.html#install-win-dist.
